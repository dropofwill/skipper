# Skipper: A Spotify API Experiment

This is a Spotify App which takes a playlist that a user drags to it and then plays each song skipping right before the track is finished.

## Installation

 1. Sign up for a [developer account on Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/#developer) by logging in and agreeing to the [terms of use](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/terms-of-use/).
 2. Create the Spotify folder if it doesn't exist already: `~/Spotify` (Mac OS X and Linux) or `My Documents\Spotify` (Windows).
 3. Open the Spotify folder.
 4. If you have git installed run `git clone https://github.com/dropofwill/Skipper.git` within this directory.
 If not, download the zip from 'https://github.com/dropofwill/Skipper' (currently the button is located in the right sidebar).
 5. Open Spotify and type "spotify:app:skipper" in the search bar (restart Spotify completely in case it doesn't find the App at first).
 6. Now just drag-and-drop a playlist into the designated field and enjoy.
