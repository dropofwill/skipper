# Skipper: A Spotify API Experiment

This is a Spotify App which takes a playlist that a user drags to it and then plays each song skipping right before the track is finished. This bypasses ads ;)

## Installation

 1. Sign up for a [developer account on Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/#developer) by logging in and agreeing to the [terms of use](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/terms-of-use/).
 2. Create the Spotify folder if it doesn't exist already: `~/Spotify` (Mac OS X and Linux) or `My Documents\Spotify` (Windows).
 3. Open the Spotify folder.
 4. Run `git clone git://github.com/spotify/apps-tutorial.git api-tutorial`.
 5. Download the [latest version of Spotify](http://spotify.com/download).
 6. Open Spotify and type "spotify:app:api-tutorial" in the search bar (restart Spotify completely in case it doesn't find the App at first).
